Since there already existed a Getopt::Simple, the name I thought I
wanted, there existed a small problem, namely what to call this
package.  With no better idea of what to call it, I posted the code to
a local mailing list and asked for comments on the name.  The
following were the runners up, in no particular order.

Getopt::Simpler
Getopt::Simplest
Get::Opt
Apprehend::CommandLine::Options
Getopt::PracticallyAtomic
Getopt::SubMolecular
Getopt::Already::Genetically::Mutating
Getopt::FitsInASig
Getopt::StaysCrunchyInMilk
Getopt::High::In::Fiber
Getopt::GotRoot?
Getopt::THIS
Getopt::Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarchie!
Getopt::Getopt::Getopt::Getopt::Getopt::Getopt::Getopt::Getopt::Getopt...Getopt
Getopt::FORTH::0::do::getopt::loop::;
Getopt::BASIC::10 PRINT "GETOPT"::20 GOTO 10::END
Getopt::Shes::A::Brick::...::House
Getopt::Jehovas::Whiteness
Getopt::Simple::EvenSimpler?


And the winner is:

Subject: Fuckin' A, Daniel! The idea strikes!


I've got the idea.

Currently, "Simple" has become the de facto package sub-identifier for
the "Alternative" version of something, whether actually simpler or
not. We need a new word.

I suggest, "Casual"!

Getopt::Casual  looks good, sounds like it listens to Jazz, and is
probably a bass player in its spare time. It wears sunglasses, even
indoors. It's C00L to be around!
